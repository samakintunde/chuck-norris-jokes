# Chuck Norris Facts Finder

This project queries the [Chuck Norris API](https://chucknorris.io) and retrieves random facts about the legendary Chuck Norris😎. Are there limitations to that man?😏

It uses React, Tailwind, React Router, React-i18n and some other smaller libraries from wonderful creators.

Uses pure state and react-router's `location.state` to pass state around.
